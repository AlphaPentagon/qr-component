### What I learned

After focusing a lot recently on Frontend frameworks and libraries like React, Next.js, styled-components and bootstrap, I wanted to challenge myself to create and style something using just pure HTML and CSS. It was great to remind myself how to set up an HTML file and how to link it to the stylesheet, as a lot of this is done for you when you use packages such as 'creat-react-app'.

I challenged myself to write clean code and structure my CSS in a way that I wasn't repeating myself. To achieve this I used global variables for the colours and created utility classes for common stylings e.g. such as adding a bottom margin of 1rem;

### Continued development

I would now like to attempt another one of the Frontend Mentor challenges, perhaps this time one that requires a responsive design or some javascript functionality. Again I would like to use pure HTML and CSS so that I can solidify some of my understanding and learning.
